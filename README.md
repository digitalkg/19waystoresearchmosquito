The research tidbits from Katie's brain. Stuff I know about stuff and other places to look up more stuff.
Saved articles, links, and whatever. 
Eventually it will be organized.

Things I'm looking at:

## Typography
World War II standards for marking vehicles, buildings, etc.

## Colors
Specifically milspec colors and their historical use in various things. 

## Nonproliferation
Because it's generally related to what I kind of do for work, and it's pretty interesting.
Also related to historical interests in terms of international relations.

## Recipes
Eating is kind of important, sometimes, and it's fun to make it interesting.
